  Web USB and Filesystem APIs
</div>

A brief overview of how they work and where they are used

---

## This presentation is an interactive demo, running in a web browser

---

# Overview

- What are these APIs are trying to solve
- Interacting with the file system and USB devices in a browser
- Real world demo


---

# There have always been limitation of the Web

- Sandboxed
- Browsers were not gaurenteed to be up to date

---

# Electron

- Provides access to Node libraries
- Let us access outside the sandbox
- Guarantee an environment your code executes in

---

## It's 2022 - Who needs electron?

- Javascript is more standardised than ever
- Browsers are evergreen
- APIs which let us break out of the sandbox have been made available

---

### Accessing files in the browser (the old way)

<FlexLayout>

<div style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
  }}>

```jsx
  <input
    type="file"
    multiple
    onChange={(event) => {
      ...
    }}
  />
```

</div>

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
  }}
>
  <LegacyFileAccessSummary />
</div>

</FlexLayout>

# Web File System Access API

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API

Currently supported on most Chromium browsers on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux

Working Draft - 24 September 2021

- Read files from a folder
- Write files into a folder
- Create folders in a folder
- Update the contents of a file
- Remove files from a folder

---

# Seems problematic?

<ReadFolderExample />

---

# Accessing only comes through a tree

<div>

```jsx
const rootHandle = await window.showDirectoryPicker({ id: "my-test" });

for await (const entry of rootHandle.values()) {
  const entryHandle = await entry.getHandle();
  await rootHandle.removeEntry(entry.name);
}
```
</div>


(Same thing in node)

<div>

```jsx
import fs from 'fs/promises';

const files = await fs.readDir("directoryName");

for (const file of files) {
  await fs.unlink('directoryName/' + file)
}
```

</div>

# In the wild

---

# Take aways

- Access is explicit (requires user interaction)
- Operations are completed against a tree like api
- Only available on chrome (for now)

---

<div style={{ fontSize: "80px", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Web USB</div>

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB

Supported in all chromium based browsers for a few years (including Android!)

- Request access to a USB device
- Access a list of previously accessed USB devices
- Open a connection to a USB device
- Read Write arbitrary USB packets

---

# Connecting to a device

```jsx
const device = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({ filters: [] });
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
  }}
>
  <UsbRequestDeviceExample />
</div>

---

# Currently connected devices (remembers existing devices)

```jsx
const device = await navigator.usb.getDevices();
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
  }}
>
  <UsbDeviceListExample />
</div>

---

# Take aways

- Access is explicit (requires user interaction)
- Devices are "paired" with a session after selection
- Some devices will still require drivers for the OS to interact with the device (windows)
